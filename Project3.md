# SYN Project 3 - How can we truly motivate individuals to take actions toward ecological changes? and What can individuals devote their personal power into this global issue?

## Introduction
When I write the Project 2 about how to get people to take actions to protect our natural environment, I keep thinking about why the global warming issue keeps detoriating, though the adovacation for decreasing CO2 emission never stops; why people dislike the extreme environmentalists, though they are probably right; why people don't take practical actions, though they deeply know the bad consequence of ecological changes. Although I explicitly describe reasons and solutions from scientists to the government to the economic structure in my project 2, I ignore what we individuals can do and why we don't want to take actions to solve these global issues. 

In the TED talk Activism needs introverts, Sarah Corbett gives me an insight into why inviduals don't take practical actions. Not every one is outrovert to accept others' demonstrations. Introvert people need more intimating and quieter ways to join the activity about the environmental protection. As also an introvert individual, I can't also easily accept the fierce demonstration.The swedish environmental activist, the Greta Thunberg, organizes fierce demonstrations and speak out "How Dare You?" in her speech. These outravert activities are difficult to resonate with the introvert individuals. These outravert activists put themselves in higher moral ground to blame others' behaviors. Facing these sudden blames, introvert individuals won't heartfeltly protect the natural environments. Although these blames could push individuals to take some actions, these actions won't be constant because if the introvert individual don't heartfeltly protect the environment, they won't insist taking actions to protect the natural environment. 

To pudh more introvert individuals in the activities, I come to realize that we should have more diverse ways to encourage more introvert individuals in the activity towrad ecological changes. Thus, I propose several solusions to invite more introvert individuals and elaborate why these solutions can work and how these solutions can work.
