# SYN Project 3 - How can we truly motivate individuals to take actions toward ecological changes? and What can individuals devote their personal power into this global issue?

## Introduction
When I write the Project 2 about how to get people to take actions to protect our natural environment, I keep thinking about why the global warming issue keeps detoriating, though the adovacation for decreasing CO2 emission never stops; why people dislike the extreme environmentalists, though they are probably right; why people don't take practical actions, though they deeply know the bad consequence of ecological changes. Although I explicitly describe reasons and solutions from scientists to the government to the economic structure in my project 2, I ignore what we individuals can do and why we don't want to take actions to solve these global issues.
