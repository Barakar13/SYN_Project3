# SYN Project 3 - How can we truly motivate individuals to take actions toward ecological changes? and What can individuals devote their personal power into this global issue?

## Introduction
When I write the Project 2 about how to get people to take actions to protect our natural environment, I keep thinking about why the global warming issue keeps deteriorating, though the advocate for decreasing CO2 emission never stops; why people dislike the extreme environmentalists, though they are probably right; why people don't take practical actions, though they deeply know the bad consequence of ecological changes. Although I explicitly describe reasons and solutions from scientists to the government to the economic structure in my project 2, I ignore what we individuals can do and why we don't want to take actions to solve these global issues. 

In the TED talk ["Activism needs introverts"](https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_corbett_activism_needs_introverts), Sarah Corbett gives me an insight into why individuals don't take practical actions. Not everyone is outrovert to accept others' demonstrations. Introverted people need more intimidating and quieter ways to join the activity about environmental protection. As also an introverted individual, I can't also easily accept the fierce demonstration.The Swedish environmental activist, the Great Thunberg, organizes fierce demonstrations and speaks out "How Dare You?" in her speech. These outravert activities are difficult to resonate with the introvert individuals. These outravert activists put themselves in higher moral ground to blame others' behaviors. Facing these sudden blames, introvert individuals won't heartfeltly protect the natural environments. Although these blames could push individuals to take some actions, these actions won't be constant because if the introvert individual don't heartfeltly protect the environment, they won't insist taking actions to protect the natural environment. 

To get more introverted individuals in the activities, I come to realize that we should have more diverse ways to encourage more introverted individuals in the activity toward ecological changes. Thus, I propose several solutions to invite more introverted individuals and elaborate why these solutions can work and how these solutions can work. 

## Recognition of Beauty of Nature Itself

In a talk ["Connecting Global Change to Local Impacts & Solutions"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHkZ7aOE3hQ&feature=youtu.be), the lecturer HayHeo create a word cloud to show what we come up with immediately about climate change. The word "Polar Bear '' largely show up in the center of this word cloud. The picture behind this word is to describe a single polar bear standing on a melting ice cap. ![polarBear](https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PRI_95003535.jpg?quality=90&strip=all) This picture shows the bad consequence caused by the global warming on the polar bear to advocate to decrease the CO2 emission. However, this type of picture limits the public in a mindset. Since the environment deteriorates and brings back consequences, we should take actions to protect the environment. This mindset doesn't truly motivate people to actively change the status quo of the environment because in this mindset, many reports of the bad consequences of ecological changes only bring hopelessness and anxiety to individuals. People intuitively like to see the positive side of one issue so why not make people appreciate the beauty of nature and understand what we will lose if the environment keeps deteriorating. ![sunsetWetland](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/09/08/21/12/sea-5555891_960_720.jpg)
In the short video, [“On A Wing and A Prayer”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV704idfOkE&t=3s), the photographer Ben Depp shows the sunset of the wetland. I was so attracted to the beauty of the wetland at that time. I easily cherish the beauty of the wetland and understand if I don’t do something, the natural beauty will disappear finally. Sometimes we decide to protect the natural environment not because the scientific reports elaborate how important it is to us and how severious the bad consequences the ecological changes will cause. Like How the author Dung states about the environmental writing in her [Is All Writing Environmental Writing?](https://thegeorgiareview.com/posts/is-all-writing-environmental-writing/), we should perceive ecological changes from the environmental perspectives. We are motivated to take actions to protect and respect the natural environment because we really appreciate the beauty of nature and want to protect the beauty. Our motivations don’t only come from the anxiety and fear about the deteriorated environment, which influences our living.
